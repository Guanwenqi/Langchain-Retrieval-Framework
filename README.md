The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various aspects of education, including remote learning. However, existing retrieval systems for remote learning resources often lack the contextual depth needed to fully address complex student queries. This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and prompt engineering techniques to create a more intuitive and effective system. Our framework is designed to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieval results, providing students with richer, more contextualized explanations and resources tailored to their specific needs. We also evaluate the performance of our approach against traditional retrieval methods, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.
